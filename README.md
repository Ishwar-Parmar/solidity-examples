## Summary of Fixes:
1. **Reentrancy Protection:** Added ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks on critical functions.
2. **Randomness Source Improvement:** Improved the randomness source to include `block.difficulty` and `block.timestamp`, but note that this approach still doesn't guarantee true randomness. For production, consider using Chainlink VRF.
3. **Gas Optimization:** Used EnumerableSet for players to avoid quadratic time complexity and unnecessary gas consumption in loops. Removed `address[] public players;` and used `EnumerableSet.AddressSet private playersSet;` instead.
4. **Duplicate Entry Prevention:** Used EnumerableSet to prevent duplicate entries efficiently.
5. **Events:** Added a `WinnerSelected` event to log the winner selection.
6. **Fee Withdrawal Check:** Added a check to ensure no active players before withdrawing fees.
7. **Miscellaneous:** Updated Solidity version to `^0.8.0` for better security features and syntax.

## Additional Improvements:
- **True Randomness:** Consider using Chainlink VRF for true randomness in production environments.
- **Gas Efficiency:** Regularly optimize and check for any possible gas savings. Consider further optimizations if new gas-efficient patterns are discovered.
